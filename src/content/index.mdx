# Welcome 👋

This short guide helps you **clone, install and run** the project in less than&nbsp;5&nbsp;minutes.  
If you are looking for more in-depth material, head over to the **Guides** and **Reference** sections in the sidebar.

## Project prerequisites

| Tool                           | Version | Notes                                           |
| ------------------------------ | :-----: | ----------------------------------------------- |
| [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) |  ≥ 18   | Required by `next` and the build step           |
| [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)       |   ≥ 8   | We use the fast, disk-efficient package manager |
| **.env** file                  |    –    | Copy `.env.example` → `.env` and fill in keys   |

<Callout type="warning">
  If you are using **nvm** make sure to <code>nvm use</code> the correct Node
  version **before** you run any commands.
</Callout>

## ➊ Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

---

## ➋ Local development

```bash
pnpm dev
```

When the server boots you should see two separate applications:

1. **Main app** – [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
2. **Docs site** – [http://localhost:3000/docs](http://localhost:3000/docs)

Changes in `app/` (product) or in `deep-wiki/src/content/` (docs) trigger **hot-reload**.

---

## ➌ Production build

```bash
pnpm build       # build everything (app _and_ docs)
pnpm start       # preview the output locally
```

---

## ➍ Project layout (quick tour)

```text
app/                     ← Next.js (App Router)
└─ api/                  ← Edge & Serverless routes
components/              ← Re-usable UI building blocks
deep-wiki/               ← Documentation site (this folder)
└─ src/content/          ← **Your .mdx docs live here**
public/                  ← Static assets (images, fonts…)
```

For a **detailed walk-through** of the docs system itself, read the
[Documentation Authoring](/guides/documentation-authoring) guide.

## ➎ Next steps

<Steps>
### Explore the code
Open the `app/` and `components/` folders – each file is typed and documented.

### Read the guides

Navigate to the **Guides** section for tutorials like _Quickstart_ and _Contributing_.

### Build something cool!

Clone a page from `app/charts` or `components/solar-panel` and start hacking.

</Steps>

Happy coding! ✨
