# Contributing

We :heart: contributions! Whether it is a **bug report**, a **new feature** or an improvement to the **documentation**, your help makes the project better for everyone.

---

## 1&nbsp;Â· Find something to work on

1. Browse the **Issues** tab and filter by the `good first issue` or `documentation` labels.
2. Join the discussion to avoid duplicate work.

<Callout type="tip">If you are unsure, open a **Draft PR** early â€“ reviewers can then give feedback as you iterate.</Callout>

---

## 2&nbsp;Â· Fork & create a branch

```bash
git checkout -b feat/my-awesome-thing
```

Use **present-tense imperative** commit messages â€“ e.g. _"Add solar panel power graph"_.

---

## 3&nbsp;Â· Run the checks locally

```bash
pnpm lint   # ESLint, TypeScript & MDX
pnpm test   # unit tests (if any)
pnpm build  # type errors & static site build
```

The CI pipeline runs the same commands â€“ make them pass locally to save round-trips.

---

## 4&nbsp;Â· Open the pull request

The PR template will ask you to confirm:

â€¢ The code builds.  
â€¢ New docs include front-matter.  
â€¢ Screenshots / GIFs for UI changes are attached.

Reviewers strive to respond within **48&nbsp;hours**. Feel free to ping after that.

## 5&nbsp;Â· Celebrate ðŸŽ‰

Your changes will land in `main` once approvals are in and checks are green. Thank you for investing your time!
